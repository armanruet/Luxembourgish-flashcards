**Next Steps**: 
1. Test the system with a few sample error reports
2. Set up your workflow for processing exported error data
3. Consider adding user instructions to help users discover the feature

The system is designed to be intuitive, but you might want to mention the error reporting capability in your app's help section or during user onboarding.
