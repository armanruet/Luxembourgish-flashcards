## Example Before/After Comparison

### Before (Card 11 - "riets"):
- **Front**: `riets (right)`
- **Back**: `[reets]`
- **Issues**: No example, no cultural context, pronunciation in wrong field

### After (Card 11 - "riets"):  
- **Front**: `riets (right) [reets]`
- **Back**: `Example: D'Gare ass riets vun der Bréck. (The station is to the right of the bridge.) Cultural context: Essential direction word used frequently in Luxembourg's multilingual environment. GPS systems and public transport announcements commonly use these directional terms.`
