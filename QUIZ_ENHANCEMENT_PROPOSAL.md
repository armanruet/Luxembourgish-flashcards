## üåü **1. IMMERSIVE REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS**

### **Interactive Story Quizzes**
Transform static questions into dynamic, branching narratives:

```typescript
interface StoryQuiz {
  scenario: string;
  choices: {
    text: string;
    outcome: string;
    nextScenario?: string;
    vocabulary: string[];
  }[];
  culturalNotes: string;
}
```

**Example Scenarios:**
- **"A Day in Luxembourg City"** - Navigate through ordering coffee, asking directions, shopping
- **"Job Interview at a Bank"** - Practice formal language and business vocabulary
- **"Weekend at the Market"** - Learn food vocabulary through shopping interactions
- **"Public Transport Adventure"** - Master transportation vocabulary and phrases

### **Role-Playing Conversations**
AI-powered dialogue practice with realistic responses:

```typescript
interface RolePlayScenario {
  character: {
    name: string;
    personality: string;
    speakingStyle: 'formal' | 'informal' | 'regional';
  };
  context: string;
  userOptions: string[];
  expectedResponses: string[];
  culturalFeedback: string;
}
```

## üé® **2. VISUAL LEARNING ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Image-Based Questions**
Replace text-only questions with visual context:

```typescript
interface VisualQuestion {
  image: string;
  question: string;
  options: {
    text: string;
    image?: string;
  }[];
  culturalContext: string;
}
```

**Visual Question Types:**
- **"What's in this picture?"** - Identify objects in Luxembourgish photos
- **"Match the word to the image"** - Connect vocabulary to visual representations
- **"Complete the scene"** - Fill in missing elements in a photo
- **"Cultural recognition"** - Identify Luxembourgish landmarks, food, traditions

### **Interactive Maps & Locations**
Learn vocabulary through geographical context:

```typescript
interface LocationQuiz {
  map: {
    center: [number, number];
    markers: {
      position: [number, number];
      label: string;
      vocabulary: string[];
    }[];
  };
  questions: QuizQuestion[];
}
```

## üéµ **3. AUDIO & PRONUNCIATION INTEGRATION**

### **Audio Comprehension Quizzes**
Listen and respond to native speakers:

```typescript
interface AudioQuestion {
  audioUrl: string;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  pronunciation: {
    slow: string;
    normal: string;
    phonetic: string;
  };
}
```

**Audio Question Types:**
- **"Listen and choose"** - Hear a word/phrase and select the correct meaning
- **"Pronunciation practice"** - Repeat after native speakers with feedback
- **"Conversation comprehension"** - Listen to dialogues and answer questions
- **"Regional accent recognition"** - Identify different Luxembourgish accents

### **Voice Recognition for Speaking**
Practice pronunciation with real-time feedback:

```typescript
interface SpeakingQuiz {
  targetPhrase: string;
  userAudio: string;
  feedback: {
    accuracy: number;
    pronunciation: string[];
    suggestions: string[];
  };
}
```

    preferredContext: string[];
  };
  questionGeneration: {
    focusAreas: string[];
    difficulty: 'A1' | 'A2' | 'B1' | 'B2';
    questionTypes: QuizQuestionType[];
  };
}
```

### **Personalized Learning Paths**
Custom quiz sequences based on goals:

```typescript
interface LearningPath {
  goal: 'travel' | 'work' | 'social' | 'academic';
  modules: {
    name: string;
    vocabulary: string[];
    scenarios: string[];
    difficulty: string;
  }[];
  progress: {
    completed: string[];
    current: string;
    next: string;
  };
}
```

    correctAnswers: number;
    streak: number;
    categories: string[];
  };
  rewards: {
    points: number;
    badges: string[];
    unlockContent: string[];
  };
}
```
