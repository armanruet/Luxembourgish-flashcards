- **New notes**: "Example of däerfen expressing permission. Shows how parents give permission to children.\n\nExample: D'Kanner däerfen den Owend méi laang opbleiwen. (The children are allowed to stay up longer tonight.)"

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/Users/arman/Desktop/Flashcard/src/data/vocabulary.ts`

### Changes Made
- **Total fixes applied**: 20 instances (10 unique flashcards × 2 versions each)
- **Pattern**: Each flashcard had both commented and uncommented versions
- **Fix approach**: Updated the `notes` field for each flashcard to include:
  - Clear explanation of the grammar concept
  - Practical example in Luxembourgish
  - English translation in parentheses
  - Proper formatting with line breaks

### Root Cause Analysis
The original error reports showed a pattern where flashcard content was being malformed into sentences like:
```
"Ech [flashcard content] Lëtzebuergesch léieren."
```

This suggested an issue with how the flashcard content was being processed or displayed, possibly in the user interface where the content was being incorrectly concatenated.

### Error Report Format
The original error reports were structured as:
```json
{
  "errorField": "notes",
  "errorDescription": "Malformed sentence pattern",
  "correctAnswer": "Proper translation/example",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

## Quality Improvements

### Before Fix Example
```typescript
notes: 'Prohibition using däerfen + net. Important for rules and regulations.'
```

### After Fix Example  
```typescript
notes: 'Prohibition using däerfen + net. Important for rules and regulations.\n\nExample: Du däerfs do net parken. (You are not allowed to park there.)'
```

### Benefits of Fixes
1. **Consistency**: All modal verb examples now follow the same format
2. **Clarity**: Each flashcard includes a practical example
3. **Learning**: English translations help with comprehension
4. **Structure**: Clear separation between explanation and example
